What is reflection in .NET? 
Reflection is a powerfulfeature that allows you to obtain information about types, members, and metadata of an assembly at runtime. 

What does reflection allow you to do? 

Retrieving information about types: You can obtain details about classes, structures, interfaces, enums, and other types defined in an assembly. This includes retrieving their properties, methods, fields, events, constructors, and attributes.

Creating instances of types dynamicallyser input or configuration settings

Invoking methods and accessing properties

Retrieving and modifying attribute information

Dynamically loading and using assemblies: Reflection enables you to load assemblies at runtime and interact with their types and members.


What are fully qualified type names? 
In C#, a fully qualified type name is a complete name that uniquely identifies a type within its namespace and assembly. It includes both the namespace and the type name.
Example-Namespace.TypeName 

What examples of practical application of reflection can you imagine? 
Frameworks and libraries that need to provide extensibility, allowing developers to plug in their custom types and behaviors.
Object serialization and deserialization, where you need to inspect and manipulate object data at runtime.
Dependency injection frameworks, where objects are instantiated and wired together based on metadata and configuration.
Testing frameworks and tools that need to discover and invoke test methods dynamically.

Is it possible to get information about private fields/methods using reflection? 
Yes, it is possible to get information about private fields and methods using reflection in C#.
